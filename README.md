# Lung-Cancer-Prediction-Python
🫁 Lung Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of lung cancer based on patient health and lifestyle data using Machine Learning algorithms.
The goal is to assist in early detection by analyzing risk factors such as smoking habits, age, and medical symptoms.

📌 Project Overview

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early diagnosis can significantly improve survival rates.
This project uses supervised machine learning models to classify whether a person is likely to have lung cancer based on input features.
